                <p>This project was undertaken as part of my master‚Äôs program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focusing on Business Analytics.</p>
                <p>The Illinois Workplace Wellness Study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace wellness programs on employee health, healthcare costs, and productivity. The study involved 4,834 employees, with 3,300 in the treatment group and 1,534 in the control group. My work focused on analyzing the program‚Äôs outcomes, identifying potential causal relationships, and examining the influence of demographic factors and selection bias on the results.</p>
                <p>The findings revealed no statistically significant health improvements, cost savings, or productivity gains, with behavioral changes limited to healthier, more engaged employees. This suggests that wellness programs may not effectively reach less healthy employees or benefit all participants equally.</p>
                <p>This project provided valuable experience in evaluating large-scale experimental data, understanding the nuances of randomized trials, and translating statistical findings into actionable business recommendations. It also emphasized the importance of inclusivity and tailored approaches in designing workplace wellness initiatives.</p>
                <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>

                <p>In this project, I analyzed the impact of driving eligibility on teenage mortality using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) research design. Leveraging death certificate data (1983‚Äì2014) and state-specific Minimum Legal Driving Age (MLDA) laws, I examined the causal relationship between gaining driving eligibility and changes in mortality rates. The analysis applied both non-parametric and parametric RD methods to assess differences in all-cause and motor vehicle accident mortality rates among teenagers just above and below the MLDA threshold.</p>
                <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>
                </br>‚Ä¢Conducted detailed data analysis on 501,193 teenage deaths over 31 years, identifying patterns in mortality rates relative to MLDA thresholds
                </br>‚Ä¢Implemented non-parametric and parametric RD approaches, analyzing how bandwidth selection affects bias, precision, and causal validity
                </br>‚Ä¢Demonstrated the trade-offs between statistical precision and bias when narrowing bandwidths around the MLDA cutoff
                </br>‚Ä¢Delivered actionable insights for policymakers on the implications of driving eligibility laws on teenage mortality

The goal was to provide actionable insights on which features drive user happiness versus dissatisfaction, and how platform dynamics (iOS vs. Android) influence outcomes.</p>
                <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>
                </br>‚Ä¢ Conducted comprehensive sentiment analysis on large-scale review data using VADER and validated it with rating-based labels for robust classification  
                </br>‚Ä¢ Applied causal DiD methods to quantify the effect of launching specific features (e.g., ‚ÄúLikes You,‚Äù ‚ÄúPassport‚Äù) on sentiment and engagement metrics  
                </br>‚Ä¢ Identified that ‚ÄúLikes You‚Äù significantly increases sentiment (+0.13), while monetized features like ‚ÄúPassport‚Äù lead to declines (~‚Äì0.09), informing feature strategy  
                </br>‚Ä¢ Built and evaluated an XGBoost classifier (AUC = 0.73) to predict negative reviews in real time for proactive product feedback monitoring  
                </br>‚Ä¢ Visualized post-launch engagement and sentiment shifts using clean, compelling plots, and communicated findings clearly to support marketing and product decisions
