        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for solving complex challenges and delivering impactful solutions. With over 4 years of experience spanning IT and the airline industries, I‚Äôve honed my skills in project management, business analysis, and deploying SaaS and on-premises solutions. My work has empowered organizations to optimize their operations, achieve ambitious goals, and thrive in dynamic markets.</p> 
            <p>Throughout my career, I‚Äôve led 25+ successful projects and resolved 30+ critical issues for global airline clients, including Jet2.com, Peach Aviation, Transavia Airlines, and others. I bring a unique ability to bridge technical and business needs, ensuring every solution I deliver is both innovative and impactful. Whether it's implementing integrated systems for airline crew management or enhancing application performance by 84% via optimized business rules coding, my focus remains on driving measurable and high-quality results.</p>
            <p>My professional journey began with a college placement at Infogain, where I secured the opportunity before even completing my final semester. At Infogain, I was deployed as a Business Analyst, outsourcing at its global clients such as Sabre and CAE. During this time, I developed expertise in Business Analysis and Project Management, delivering innovative aviation software solutions and providing consulting services. My work involved managing critical SaaS implementations for airlines, designing robust systems, and ensuring seamless project execution. Recognizing my impactful contributions to their business, CAE brought me on board as a full-time employee. These experiences offered invaluable global exposure, allowing me to collaborate with diverse teams and clients to address complex business challenges effectively.</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate years, I interned at HighRadius, where I delved into AI-driven solutions and analytics, developing a strong foundation in problem-solving and strategic thinking. This experience reinforced my drive to explore innovative technologies and their real-world applications.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at the University of Iliinois Urbana-Champaign Gies College of Business, expanding my expertise in data-driven strategies, advanced analytics, and machine learning. My recent work includes an AI/ML project aimed at optimizing pharmaceutical manufacturing processes‚Äîan exciting challenge at the crossroads of technology and innovation.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about traveling, immersing myself in new cultures, and building meaningful connections with people from all walks of life. Singing and music are a huge part of my life‚Äîthey inspire and energize me, whether I‚Äôm performing or simply enjoying my favorite tunes. I also love painting and sketching, which serve as creative outlets that fuel my imagination. Additionally, I am committed to social service, organizing community initiatives and campaigns to create a positive impact.</p>
            <p>Technology, to me, is not just a career‚Äîit's the bridge that empowers business transformation. Every project I undertake and every solution I develop combines the power of innovation with strategic business insight, aiming to drive impactful change and elevate organizational success.</p>
        </br><em>Fun Fact:</em> I once coded for 5 days straight (with small breaks) to complete a project! and I can do contortion!</p>

                <p>As part of my Master‚Äôs program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I completed a project focused on enhancing the accuracy and fairness of property tax assessments for the Cook County Assessor‚Äôs Office (CCAO).</p>
                <p>The project involved developing a data-driven predictive model to estimate residential property market values with minimal Mean Squared Error (MSE), supporting CCAO‚Äôs mission to address historical inaccuracies and public dissatisfaction. Leveraging historical data, I applied advanced regression techniques to ensure transparency, accuracy, and interpretability.                </p>
                <p>This project underscored the importance of balancing accuracy and interpretability in predictive modeling while addressing real-world challenges in public policy and taxation.</p>
                <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>
                </br>‚Ä¢Evaluated four regression methodologies, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, k-Fold Cross-Validation, and Validation Set Approaches
                </br>‚Ä¢Delivered a final predictive model (Multiple Linear Regression with Validation Set Approach) using 5 key predictors, achieving an R-Squared accuracy of 94.59% with an MSE of 3111.19

                <p>This project was undertaken as part of my master‚Äôs program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focusing on Business Analytics.</p>
                <p>The Illinois Workplace Wellness Study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace wellness programs on employee health, healthcare costs, and productivity. The study involved 4,834 employees, with 3,300 in the treatment group and 1,534 in the control group. My work focused on analyzing the program‚Äôs outcomes, identifying potential causal relationships, and examining the influence of demographic factors and selection bias on the results.</p>
                <p>The findings revealed no statistically significant health improvements, cost savings, or productivity gains, with behavioral changes limited to healthier, more engaged employees. This suggests that wellness programs may not effectively reach less healthy employees or benefit all participants equally.</p>
                <p>This project provided valuable experience in evaluating large-scale experimental data, understanding the nuances of randomized trials, and translating statistical findings into actionable business recommendations. It also emphasized the importance of inclusivity and tailored approaches in designing workplace wellness initiatives.</p>
                <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>
                </br>‚Ä¢Conducted hypothesis testing and statistical analysis using linear regression to evaluate program effectiveness
                </br>‚Ä¢Analyzed the impact of randomization and demographic controls on outcome measures, such as healthcare spending, office visits, and chronic conditions
                </br>‚Ä¢Identified selection bias and its influence on program outcomes, highlighting areas for targeted interventions

                <p>This project was undertaken as part of my master‚Äôs program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focusing on Big Data Analytics.</p>
                <p>In this project, I analyzed the impact of driving eligibility on teenage mortality using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) research design. Leveraging death certificate data (1983‚Äì2014) and state-specific Minimum Legal Driving Age (MLDA) laws, I examined the causal relationship between gaining driving eligibility and changes in mortality rates. The analysis applied both non-parametric and parametric RD methods to assess differences in all-cause and motor vehicle accident mortality rates among teenagers just above and below the MLDA threshold.</p>
                <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>
                </br>‚Ä¢Conducted detailed data analysis on 501,193 teenage deaths over 31 years, identifying patterns in mortality rates relative to MLDA thresholds
                </br>‚Ä¢Implemented non-parametric and parametric RD approaches, analyzing how bandwidth selection affects bias, precision, and causal validity
                </br>‚Ä¢Demonstrated the trade-offs between statistical precision and bias when narrowing bandwidths around the MLDA cutoff
                </br>‚Ä¢Delivered actionable insights for policymakers on the implications of driving eligibility laws on teenage mortality
                </br>‚Ä¢Effectively communicated findings through well-structured reports and visualizations, ensuring clarity for diverse stakeholders
