        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for solving complex challenges and delivering impactful solutions. With over 4 years of experience spanning IT and the airline industries, I‚Äôve honed my skills in project management, business analysis, and deploying SaaS and on-premises solutions. My work has empowered organizations to optimize their operations, achieve ambitious goals, and thrive in dynamic markets.</p> 
            <p>Throughout my career, I‚Äôve led 25+ successful projects and resolved 30+ critical issues for global airline clients, including Jet2.com, Peach Aviation, Transavia airlines, and others. I bring a unique ability to bridge technical and business needs, ensuring every solution I deliver is both innovative and impactful. Whether it's designing integrated systems for airline crew management or enhancing application performance by 84%, my focus remains on driving measurable results.</p>
            <p>My professional journey began with a college placement at Infogain, where I secured the opportunity before even completing my final semester. At Infogain, I was deployed as a Business Analyst, outsourcing at its global clients such as Sabre and CAE. During this time, I developed expertise in Business Analysis and Project Management, delivering innovative aviation software solutions and providing consulting services. My work involved managing critical SaaS implementations for airlines, designing robust systems, and ensuring seamless project execution. Recognizing my impactful contributions to their business, CAE brought me on board as a full-time employee. These experiences offered invaluable global exposure, allowing me to collaborate with diverse teams and clients to address complex business challenges effectively.</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate years, I interned at HighRadius, where I delved into AI-driven solutions and analytics, developing a strong foundation in problem-solving and strategic thinking. This experience reinforced my drive to explore innovative technologies and their real-world applications.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at the University of Iliinois Urbana-Champaign Gies College of Business, expanding my expertise in data-driven strategies, advanced analytics, and machine learning. My recent work includes an AI/ML project aimed at optimizing pharmaceutical manufacturing processes‚Äîan exciting challenge at the crossroads of technology and innovation.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about traveling, immersing myself in new cultures, and building meaningful connections with people from all walks of life. Singing and music are a huge part of my life‚Äîthey inspire and energize me, whether I‚Äôm performing or simply enjoying my favorite tunes. I also love painting and sketching, which serve as creative outlets that fuel my imagination. Additionally, I am committed to social service, organizing community initiatives and campaigns to create a positive impact.</p>
            <p>Technology, to me, is not just a career‚Äîit's the bridge that empowers business transformation. Every project I undertake and every solution I develop combines the power of innovation with strategic business insight, aiming to drive impactful change and elevate organizational success.</p>
        </br><em>Fun Fact:</em> I once coded for 5 days straight (with small breaks) to complete a project! and I can do contortion!</p>
